# Open Banking API demo

This is project is to demonstrate [OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md) and [OAuth2](https://alexbilbie.com/guide-to-oauth-2-grants/) technology.

[cds.yaml](https://github.com/fyang1024/open-bank-api/blob/master/cds.yaml) is the API spec in OpenAPI 3.0 format. It is converted from [the doc in OpenAPI 2.0 format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards/master/swagger-gen/cds_full.json). 

The spec exposes a set of banking related APIs and a common customer API. I have added OAuth2 security scheme onto it.

The `client` folder contains 2 projects:
* `java` is the java version client
* `js` is the nodejs version client

The `server` folder contains 2 projects:
* `auth` is the OAuth2 server
* `resource` is the Resource server (API end points provider)

Both projects are implemented with Spring boot 2 framework.

I recorded a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Yisb555fs) to demo them working together.

I have deployed them to Heroku. You can play it here https://openbank-resource.herokuapp.com
The username / password are user / pass respectively when you authorize the swagger ui to access the APIs
